### Installing Dependencies
Before you can use the development version of this plugin you must install the dependencies.

### CSS/JS Development

```
# Run localhost:4000 with hot reload
yarn dev

# Add the following to your wp-config.php
define( 'SCRIPT_DEBUG', true );
define( 'BGEDITOR_SCRIPT_DEBUG', true );
```

### Build for production
The full build is committed to github (changing soon). Before pushing up your changes, run the following command to ensure all assets are updated.
```
yarn build
